# LaunchAppsGUI
A simple multi application launcher using Python

# Installation
Simply download all files as .zip, extract them to a designated location, then run PythonGuiapp.exe.
 
# How do I use the application?
After running PythonGuiapp.exe, simply append any files you'd like to open using the 'Open File' button. From there, your files will save to 'save.txt', and you can run them using the 'Run apps' button. 

The applications you've selected are read from save.txt, so each time you run PythonGuiapp.exe, it will remember the applications you've originally set.

# Starting over
If you'd like to start the application from scratch with base installation properties, simply delete save.txt in the LaunchAppsGUI folder. 

# Modification
To modify which applications are run, you can write them into save.txt directly with their file location.
